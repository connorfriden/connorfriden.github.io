									<h1>Horizon</h1>
									<p>A kiosk application developed to coordinate services in homeless shelters.</p>

							<center> <h1>About</h1> </center>
							<p style="text-align:center">At the beginning of the Fall 2019 semester, teams were tasked
								with brainstorming project ideas that they would eventually
								prototype to create an application. Our team leader, Muhammad,
								came up with the idea of creating a kiosk interface that would
								allow the homeless to gain access to services that they need.
								My role was that of a designer and researcher. I took notes
								during interviews, created prototype mockups, and gave a pitch
								for our project during our first sprint.</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">Horizon is a kiosk application that
								will allow the homeless to acquire services that will address
								their basic needs for food, shelter, and medical attention.
								Our team utilized the Lean UX process as a guideline for our
								project, and we had to keep up with a schedule and meet specific
								 deadlines. Lean UX ensured that our small team was not only
								 highly collaborative, but also very focused on the problems
								 at hand. Our project was broken up into two “Sprints” and two
								 “Design 0” weeks at the beginning of each sprint. Put simply,
								 the Lean UX process involved our team creating prototypes that
								  would constantly change based upon feedback received in user
									testing and interview</p>

									<center> <h1>The Process</h1> </center>
									<center> <h2>PRODUCT PROBLEM STATEMENT (SPRINT 1)</h2> </center>
									<p style="text-align:center">We started off the process by
										creating a product problem statement. In this statement we
										determined the current state of the market, the opportunities
										we intend to exploit, and our strategy to market the application.</p>

										<center> <h2>ASSUMPTIONS (SPRINT 1)</h2> </center>
										<p style="text-align:center">We started by filling out our
											assumption sheets individually, and then we came together
											to create a group assumption sheet. Here are some of our assumptions:</p>
											<p style="text-align:center">- Initial users will be social workers and volunteers</p>
											<p style="text-align:center">- Kiosk located at shelters, religious org., libraries, college/uni care center.</p>
											<p style="text-align:center">- Revenue by leasing application to private run org, as well as sponsors for ads.</p>

											<center> <h2>AFFINITY MAPPING (SPRINT 1)</h2> </center>
											<p style="text-align:center">The next stage in our project
												 involved creating affinity maps that would allow us to
												 discover any patterns based on our assumptions. The maps
												  allowed us to understand the mindset of each team member
													 moving forward. Through affinity mapping we were able
													  to narrow down four basic needs for our primary user:
														Food, Showers, Shelter, and Medical.</p>

														<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

											<center> <h2>PRODUCT BACKLOG/HYPOTHESIS TABLE (SPRINT 1)</h2> </center>
											<p style="text-align:center">As a team, we created a product
												 backlog and multiple hypothesis statements that we knew
												  would change as we progressed through the project.
													Based on our hypothesis statements, we came up with
													business outcomes that would get our product out into
													the market and make it a viable business. Our product
													backlog underwent many changes throughout Sprint 1 and
													 was finalized during Sprint 2. Once we conducted interviews
													  and did more research, we were able to complete the
														backlog and remove anything that didn’t belong.</p>

											<center> <h2>PROTO PERSONAS (SPRINT 1/SPRINT 2)</h2> </center>
											<p style="text-align:center">With the information gathered
												from our assumption sheets, affinity maps, and product
												backlog, we came up with three proto personas for our kiosk.</p>

												<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

												<p style="text-align:center">Borris and Rachel were the
													 only personas that experienced change in Sprint 2.
													 Our primary persona, Borris, simply had his level of
													 education changed and his primary goal to have an
													 education rather than a job and an education. One of
													 our secondary personas, Rachel, experienced the most
													 change. Rachel’s title went from “Social Worker” to
													 “Case Manager” as a result of our interview with Must
													  Ministries. Her primary obstacle was changed from
														outdated government software to the large packets of
														 paper that case managers have to deal with.</p>

														 <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

												<center> <h2>PROTOTYPES (SPRINT 1)</h2> </center>
												<p style="text-align:center">Next, we have our prototypes.
													We started with diagraming our key path and determining
													 the ways in which our personas would interact with the kiosk.</p>

													 <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

													 <center> <h3>PAPER FIDELITY</h3> </center>
													 <p style="text-align:center">After diagraming our key
														  path, we then drew some paper prototypes. While
															very basic, they laid out the foundation on how we
															 want our kiosk to appear aesthetically.</p>

															 <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

														<center> <h3>LOW FIDELITY</h3> </center>
														<p style="text-align:center">Our paper prototypes
															led to these low fidelity mockups, which brought
															us even closer to a usable prototype</p>

															<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

														<center> <h3>MEDIUM FIDELITY</h3> </center>
														<p style="text-align:center">Our low fidelity mock
															ups eventually led us to our medium fidelity prototype
															 which underwent many changes in both sprints.
															 The images to the left represent the final state
															 of our prototype at the end of Sprint 1.</p>

															 <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

														<center> <h3>PROTOTYPES HIGH FIDELITY (SPRINT 2)</h3> </center>
														<p style="text-align:center">Our final prototype was
															 a culmination of the information we gathered in
															 all of our interviews and user testing. Our prototype
															  did not undergo any drastic changes from Sprint
																1 to Sprint 2, but the small changes we made were
																 not without much debate and discussion. Here is
																  the current and final state of our prototype:</p>

																	<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

															<center> <h2>INTERVIEWS</h2> </center>
															<p style="text-align:center">The interviews we
																conducted were instrumental in affecting the
																decisions we made throughout the course of our
																project. Before we conducted our first interview,
																 we knew a lot less about our project than we
																 had previously thought. We realized that we were
																  incorrect in many of our assumptions about
																	both our primary and secondary personas. Our
																	first interview with CARE Services at Kennesaw
																	 State may have been our only interview in
																	 Sprint 1, but the information was helpful.</p>

																<center> <h2>INTERVIEW: CARE CENTER</h2> </center>
																<p style="text-align:center">Our interview with
																	CARE Services was informative. We gathered
																	invaluable information about how CARE services
																	operate at KSU. Our interviewee also gave us
																	feedback by stating that our kiosk would be a
																	valuable asset on a college campus. The kiosk
																	would be especially useful to have after hours
																	 when CARE employees aren’t around. While the
																	 information we gathered primarily pertained
																	 to students, we still needed to understand the
																	 struggles of the homeless regardless of demographic.</p>

																	 <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

																	 <center> <h2>INTERVIEW: CARE CENTER PART 2</h2> </center>
	 																<p style="text-align:center">We met with one of
																		 the directors of CARE Services at Kennesaw
																		 State. During this interview we gained information
																		  about the intake process for students and
																			the services they can access. We learned
																			about CARE’s connections with other organizations.
																			 We also received feedback about our prototype
																			  and some features that we should consider.
																				We learned that our kiosk would need to be
																				 explicit in determining the cost of locations
																				  if any and specifying whether the locations
																					 are safe to avoid liability. Other
																					 features and recommendations the
																					 director provided caused debate amongst
																					  our team about what was most realistic
																						 for us to include.</p>

																						 <center> <h2>INTERVIEW: MUST MINISTRIES</h2> </center>
						 																<p style="text-align:center">Our second
																							 and perhaps most important interview
																							  of the entire project was with Must
																								 Ministries. We spoke with a case
																								  manager who provided us with
																									information that altered the
																									layout of our prototype and
																									corrected some of our assumptions
																									 about our personas. For example,
																									  we learned that most of the
																										homeless are in fact literate
																										 and many have mobile devices
																										  at their disposal. As a result,
																											 we replaced laundry over
																											 medical services as a priority
																											  for our primary personas.
																												Our secondary persona,
																												Rachel Evans, also had her
																												 role change from social
																												 worker to case manager as
																												  a result of this interview.</p>

																													<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>

																								<center> <h2>MY CONTRIBUTION</h2> </center>
																								<ul style="text-align:center; list-style-type:none;">
																									<li>Took notes during user testing/interviews</li>

																									<li>Helped organize the product backlog</li>
																									<li>Helped finalize the product problem statement</li>
																									<li>Created paper prototypes</li>
																									<li>Created low fidelity mockups</li>
																									<li>Helped create an affinity map</li>
																									<li>Created potential workshops that would be used in the prototype</li>
																									<li>Created a script and PowerPoint for the Sprint 1 presentation</li>
																									<li>Presented the state of our project at the end of Sprint 1</li>
																								</ul>

																								<center> <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2> </center>
	 						 																<p style="text-align:center">I was
																								 nervous going into this semester,
																								  but my team members were helpful
																									 throughout the course of this
																									  project. I am proud of what
																										we accomplished during the semester.
																										 I am also proud of our project itself.
																										  I knew it would be ambitious
																											and difficult, but I feel good
																											about what we created. I am a
																											better person for working on an
																											app that helps people. The project
																											has opened my eyes to the situation
																											of the homeless. I hope that someday
																											someone will create a kiosk like ours.
																											It’s been challenging. The lean UX
																											 has been intense and I am a better
																											 interaction designer because of it.</p>
