							<center> <h2>About</h2> </center>
							<p style="text-align:center">At the beginning of our semester,
								students were tasked to pitch an app idea to our Interaction
								Design class, and form groups to create one. My team leader
								proposed the idea of Swap and Shop, a virtual car part swap meet,
								 due to his interest in cars. I chose to be a part of Joey's
								 group because I am also interested in cars and car parts.
								 As a team member, my job was to assist my team leader with any of the tasks at hand.
 							 I was also tasked with assisting my fellow group member, Wendy with anything
 						 our team leader needed us to get done. Our team leader gave us a lot of
  				 freedom in designing our app, so I used my artistic abilities to help my group
	 			 to develop an aesthetically pleasing product. Aside from that, I was also
	 		 tasked with taking notes during both rounds of our user testing.</p>


									<center> <h2>Goal Directed Design</h2> </center>
									<p style="text-align:center">For this project, our team
										followed the ideas of Goal Directed Design, developed by
										Alan Cooper. These ideas lay out the framework for the project,
										 and include the planning, research, modeling, testing and
										 the refining of our work. Goal Directed Design must be followed
										  in a specific order to be accomplished correctly.</p>

										<center> <h2>Literature Review and Competitive Audit</h2> </center>
										<p style="text-align:center">Once groups were formed, and
											our team had established what the project was we did a
											Literature Review. Essentially, this is looking at
											 and other pieces written on our subject, in this case,
											 buying car parts. The purpose of this is to see what prior
											  research has been done, and what we are looking at in terms of creating an app.</p>
											<p style="text-align:center">The Competitive Audit is used
												 to take a look at our competition. We used this to see
												 what they did similarily, differently, and what we could
												  do to set ourselves apart from them.</p>


											<center> <h2>First Round of Interviews</h2> </center>
											<p style="text-align:center">After the initial research,
												we set out to ask people what they would want in a Car
												part app, and what current methods they use to buy car
												parts. Since not everyone purchases car parts, we decided
												 the best way to go about this interviewing people at car
												  shows. We went to Caffeine and Octane in Atlanta, and
													got lots of information from true car people there.</p>
													<p style="text-align:center">From our interviews and
														prior research, we found that there is no one way
														everyone buys parts, and that many sites exist.
														However, many people have to go to specific sites
														for some parts, or don't trust others as much. This
														 is where we wanted to capitalize, by being a trustworthy
														  location to buy and sell, and have everything all in one place.</p>

											<center> <h2>PRODUCT BACKLOG/HYPOTHESIS TABLE (SPRINT 1)</h2> </center>
											<p style="text-align:center">As a team, we created a product
												 backlog and multiple hypothesis statements that we knew
												  would change as we progressed through the project.
													Based on our hypothesis statements, we came up with
													business outcomes that would get our product out into
													the market and make it a viable business. Our product
													backlog underwent many changes throughout Sprint 1 and
													 was finalized during Sprint 2. Once we conducted interviews
													  and did more research, we were able to complete the
														backlog and remove anything that didnâ€™t belong.</p>

											<center> <h2>Personas</h2> </center>
											<p style="text-align:center">We developed two primary personas,
												 a buyer and a seller, that we would create the app for.
												 Combined with their expectations, we created a context
												 scenario for when someone would use the app. These allowed
												  us to make sure we were designing for the right people at all times.</p>

												<div class="image main"><img src="images/Personas.jpg" alt="Two primary personas" /></div>



												<center> <h2>Low Fidelity Prototyping</h2> </center>
												<p style="text-align:center">Once we finally knew what
													was needed, and expected in the app, our team was able
													 to start Lo-fi prototyping. Our team each came up
													 with our own ideas, then we took the best ideas to
													 combine into a few final iterations. This became the
													 basis for our first digital prototype.</p>

													 <center> <h2>Prototyping Iteration 1</h2> </center>
													 <p style="text-align:center">The team then each came
														 up with digital prototypes based on the lo-fi prototypes.
														  Joey's was selected to use for usability testing.</p>

														<center> <h3>Usability Testing</h3> </center>
														<p style="text-align:center">Due to a time crunch,
															our team was only able to test three participants,
															 but we got similar feedback from each, which we
															 considered invaluable. We tasked users to go
															 through the basic functions of the app, and give
															  feedback not only on how it worked, but on what
																 have made it better.</p>



														<center> <h3>Prototyping Iteration 2</h3> </center>
														<p style="text-align:center">After testing, we made
															some revisions based on the comments recieved by
															participants, the main problems were:</p>
															<ul style="text-align:center; list-style-type:none;">
																<li>It was difficult to tell what was clickable</li>
																<li>"Willing to Trade" was confusing</li>
																<li> Lockouts should be present if information is not filled out correctly</li>
															</ul>
															<p style="text-align:center">These problems were addressed in the second and final iteration.</p>

														<center> <h3>Final Product</h3> </center>
														<p style="text-align:center">After lots of research,
															 interviews, prototyping and testing, the final version of Swap and Shop was created.</p>

														<div class="image main"><img src="images/FinalProduct1.jpg" alt="Final app screen captures" /></div>
														<div class="image main"><img src="images/FinalProduct2.jpg" alt="Final app screen captures" /></div>

														<div class="image main"><img src="images/FinalProduct4.jpg" alt="Final app screen captures" /></div>
														<div class="image main"><img src="images/FinalProduct5.jpg" alt="Diagram of completed application" /></div>
														<center> <h2>Presentation</h2> </center>
															<p style="text-align:center">The last day of class
																 our team leader (Joey) gave a presentation of
																 the app to the class acting as stakeholders.
																 He went over the process of how we got to where
																  we are, and the reasoning behind it</p>

																	<p style="text-align:center">This was the first
																		 time I have ever done a group project of
																		 this scope and scale. This was also the
																		 first time I have ever been involved in
																		 anything to do with user testing and interviews.
																		  I have to say the whole process was very
																			intimidating at first, but my group helped
																			 me get through it. I ended up enjoying the
																			  process over time, and I'm glad I have
																				some experience under my belt moving forward.</p>
