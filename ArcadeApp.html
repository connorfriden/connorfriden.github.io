								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>In my User Interface Design 2 class, teams were tasked with replicating traditional physical spaces and replicating them digitally. Each team chose their own physical space or experience. Our team decided on arcades, and we worked throughout the semester to develop a tested prototype solution. We followed the Sprint Framework written by Jake Knapp to help guide us through the process.</p>

								<h2>Solution Showcase</h2>
								<p>This is the final solution that our team came up with at the end of the semester. Our solution was to create a way to reduce wait time in between games by allowing users to navigate to other games more efficiently. To do this, we created a pause menu that leads to the games menu, and we made a sidebar that would allow users to navigate to their favorite games quickly. We found this to be the most efficient way to reduce wait times in between games.</p>

								<h2>User Research</h2>
								<p>Before we could begin designing anything for our project, we first had to conduct user research. Individually, we came up with potential questions for our participant interview script. We decided on which questions worked best and created a script to be used in user testing interviews. This script included questions such as:</p>

								<ul style="text-align:left; ">
								<li>Do you prefer to visit arcades alone, or go with friends?</li>
								<li>Do you always leave an arcade satisfied? Why or why not?</li>
								<li>What kinds of things would improve the experience of visiting arcades for you?</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Using our script, we interviewed five participants and created affinity maps based on our test results. Each interviewee shared different insights, so we needed to organize the data they provided. Here were some of our takeaways/insights:</p>


							<!--	<center><div class="image main"><img style="width:; height:;"src="images/interviews.png" alt="interviews" /></div></center> -->

								

								<ul style="text-align:left; ">
								<li>Wait time for games is a common problem.</li>
								<li>Arcades are best enjoyed with others.</li>
								<li>Game variety is important.</li>
								</ul>



								<h2>Map of the Problem</h2>
								<p>After gathering all of our data during user research, we moved on to mapping our problem. The map is simple. The map lists out the actors, key steps, and the end goal of what we are trying to create. The importance of the map was that it allowed us to visualize our end goal and help prepare us for our solutions and our prototype.</p>

								<center><div class="image main"><img style="width:; height:;"src="images/arcade_map.png" alt="map" /></div></center>

								<h2>Prioritization</h2>
								<p>Once we mapped out our problem, we prioritized and formulated a “how might we” statement. An HMW statement converts problems into opportunities and lets us know which part of our map will target, giving us ideas for our future sketches. We each created our statements and organized the ones we believed were best. We ranked our statements based on:</p>

								<ul style="text-align:left; ">
								<li>Highest priority.</li>
								<li>User need.</li>
								<li>Feasibility based on groups expertise.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>At the end of the activity, we determined that “How might we reduce wait time for games” would be our HMW statement because it fit all the criteria above.</p>

								<h2>Design Critique / Art Museum</h2>
								<p>Once we decided on our HMW statement, we could begin the art museum activities and critiques. Each team member created their storyboard that depicts users interacting with our application. We then used dot voting to determine the best elements from each storyboard, as you can see below:</p>

								<center><div class="image main"><img style="width:70%; height:70%;"src="images/designs1.png" alt="designs 1" /></div></center>

								<center><div class="image main"><img style="width:70%; height:70%;"src="images/designs2.png" alt="designs 2" /></div></center>

								<p>Once we decided on the elements we wanted to include in our app, we could begin creating low-fidelity iterations. The most critical aspects we took from our storyboards were:</p>

								<ul style="text-align:left; ">
								<li>A pop-out game list (my idea).</li>
								<li>A games playlist.</li>
								<li>Game lobbies (multiplayer).</li>
								</ul>

								<p>All of these features focused on a faster and more efficient way to play games. We considered these features when creating our prototype. We made two prototypes that we wanted to test with our users. One prototype featured the pop-out games list, and the other prototype featured a pause screen that took the user back to the main menu. The pop-out menu would take the user directly from game to game, while the pause screen would take the user back to a game selection screen. We decided to prioritize the pop-out list and menu, so we decided not to include the game lobby in the prototype for testing.</p>


								<h2>User Testing</h2>
								<p>For our user testing, we decided on an A/B test for our users. An A/B test involves two test variants, A and B. We chose this method because we had two variants of our prototype that we wanted to test on our users. Our first half of the test involved the pop-out game list, and the second half tested the pause screen and games playlist. The two versions we tested can be seen below:</p>

								<center><div class="image main"><img style="width:70%; height:70%;"src="images/arcade_prototype.png" alt="prototypes" /></div></center>

								<p>From our tests, we were able to draw some conclusions:</p>

								<ul style="text-align:left; ">
								<li>Users were confused by the pop-out menu.</li>
								<li>Prototype B (pause menu/games playlist) was the most preferred.</li>
								<li>The pop-out menu should be favorite or recent games.</li>
								<li>Elements from both prototypes should be combined.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Compared to our first round of interviews in the research phase, there were many commonalities concerning feedback in user testing. The pop-out menu was almost universally confusing and hard to identify, and the pop-out menu would best be utilized as a favorites tab rather than a complete game list. We also determined that while most users preferred prototype B, they still wanted to integrate the game list. Overall we were pleased with our test results and glad the interviewees liked our ideas.</p>



								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>After all of the testing and activities, we finally made a solution to our problem. We successfully created a prototype that would allow users to play games on their phones in the most efficient way possible. While the process certainly wasn’t easy, especially with us being entirely virtual, I am proud of our team’s work throughout the semester. During this class, I improved upon my communication and collaboration skills by working with my team. I also learned more about the sprint framework and how to work in an agile environment where change is constant. </p>

								<p>My main takeaway from our project is that there will always be solutions to problems despite a significant obstacle like a global pandemic. A crisis can take away some of the most critical aspects of our lives, like socializing, going to concerts, and playing games in arcades. However, things will have to change, and people will have to adapt and overcome. Our class proved this with our projects. We demonstrated that if a pandemic wants to take away our favorite activities, we can still find a way to enjoy them.</p>
